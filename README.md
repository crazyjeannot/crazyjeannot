### Hi! 
I'm Jean BarrÃ©, a PhD student in computational literary studies at [Ã‰cole Normale SupÃ©rieure](https://www.ens.psl.eu/) & [LaTTiCE](https://www.lattice.cnrs.fr/) lab. 
- Iâ€™m interested in Literary History, Natural Language Processing, Machine learning, Stylometry and more...
- I'm trying to operationalize literary theory concepts (Canonicity, Subgenres, Literary Variability) and model them in large literary corpora.
